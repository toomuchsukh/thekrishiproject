# thekrishiproject
The Krishi Project at its core is an an android application built with backend help from Firebase.

Its main goal is to provide a multifaceted platform- a one-stop space for farmers.

Directed to assist farmers all across the country, the project’s main goal is to empower and educate all farmers- as there are far too many of them who are under-represented and don’t have the help they need.

Another important goal that needs highlighting is the need to increase the awareness on the health benefits of organic and “green” farming. This projects aims to reinvigorate traditional farming practices and create a more holistic opportunity for farmers to improve.
